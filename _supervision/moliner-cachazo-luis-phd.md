## PhD Graduate (2020-2024)

**Project Title:** Evaluating ecological assembly rules for aquatic-terrestrial transition zones in the Okavango Delta, Botswana

**Co-supervision:** 
- Michael Chadwick (University College London)
- Jane Catford (King's College London)
- Anson Mackay (University College London)

**Funding:** London DTP (UKRI)

**Research Focus:**
Luis's PhD research investigated the fundamental ecological processes that govern species assembly and community structure in the unique aquatic-terrestrial transition zones of the Okavango Delta in Botswana. This work addressed critical questions about how different environmental gradients and habitat characteristics influence biodiversity patterns in one of Africa's most important wetland ecosystems.

**Key Research Areas:**
- Ecological assembly rules
- Aquatic-terrestrial transition zones
- Wetland ecology
- Biodiversity patterns
- African freshwater ecosystems
- Community ecology
- Environmental gradients

**Research Significance:**
The Okavango Delta represents one of the world's largest inland deltas and is a UNESCO World Heritage site of exceptional biodiversity importance. Luis's research contributed fundamental insights into how species communities are structured across environmental gradients, with implications for understanding ecosystem functioning and conservation management in similar wetland systems globally.

**PhD Outcome:**
Luis successfully completed his PhD in 2024 and has continued his research career as a postdoctoral researcher, building on his expertise in freshwater ecology to develop new molecular approaches for biodiversity monitoring.

**Publications:**
His PhD research resulted in several high-impact publications, including comprehensive taxonomic reviews and methodological contributions to freshwater biodiversity assessment.
