## MSc Student (2025)

**Project Title:** The Taxonomic use of Artificial Intelligence for Identifying Caddisfly Larvae, based upon the Greenwood Collection

**Research Focus:**
Jingzhi's MSc research focuses on developing artificial intelligence approaches for the taxonomic identification of caddisfly larvae, utilizing the extensive Greenwood Collection housed at the Natural History Museum. This work addresses the challenging task of larval identification in Trichoptera, which requires significant taxonomic expertise and is often a bottleneck in ecological and biodiversity studies.

**Key Research Areas:**
- Artificial intelligence in taxonomy
- Caddisfly (Trichoptera) larval identification
- Museum collection digitisation
- Automated species identification
- Machine learning applications in entomology

**Research Significance:**
Caddisfly larvae are important indicators of freshwater ecosystem health, but their identification requires specialized knowledge that limits their use in biomonitoring and ecological research. Jingzhi's work aims to democratize access to taxonomic expertise through AI-powered identification tools.

**Collection Context:**
The Greenwood Collection represents one of the most comprehensive collections of British and European Trichoptera larvae, providing an excellent foundation for training machine learning models with taxonomically verified specimens.

**Expected Outcomes:**
This research will contribute to the development of practical tools for freshwater biomonitoring and will demonstrate the potential for AI applications in museum-based taxonomic research.
