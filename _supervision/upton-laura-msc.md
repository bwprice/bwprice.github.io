## MSc Graduate (2015) - Published Research

**Project Title:** Applying novel digital visualization tools and traditional morphometrics to the analysis of wing size and asymmetry and to male wing spot size in *Calopteryx splendens* (Harris) (Banded Demoiselle)

**Co-supervision:** 
- Steve Brooks (Natural History Museum)
- Dr Diana Percy (Natural History Museum)

**Publication Status:** **Published** - Journal of the British Dragonfly Society 32: 8-25 (2016)

**Research Focus:**
Laura's MSc research combined innovative digital visualization techniques with traditional morphometric approaches to investigate wing characteristics in the Banded Demoiselle (*Calopteryx splendens*). Her work focused on analyzing wing size, asymmetry patterns, and the distinctive male wing spots that are important for both species identification and mate selection.

**Key Research Areas:**
- Digital morphometrics and visualization
- Odonata wing morphology
- Sexual selection and wing ornamentation
- Asymmetry analysis
- Traditional and digital measurement techniques
- Male secondary sexual characteristics

**Research Significance:**
The study of wing spot size and asymmetry in *C. splendens* contributes to our understanding of sexual selection in odonates and the role of wing ornamentation in mate choice. Additionally, the methodological advances demonstrated in this work have applications across numerous other studies of insect morphology.
