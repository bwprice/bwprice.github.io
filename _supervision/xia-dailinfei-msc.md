## MSc Student (2025)

**Project Title:** AI-driven identification of beetle collections, combining machine learning tools with morphological analysis to accelerate identification and curation

**Research Focus:**
Dailinfei's MSc research focuses on developing artificial intelligence approaches for the identification of beetle specimens in museum collections. The project combines cutting-edge machine learning techniques with traditional morphological analysis to create tools that can accelerate specimen identification and improve curation workflows in natural history museums.

**Key Research Areas:**
- Machine learning for taxonomic identification
- Beetle (Coleoptera) systematics
- Computer vision applications
- Museum collection management
- Morphological analysis automation
- Digital curation workflows

**Research Significance:**
Beetles represent the most diverse group of animals on Earth, comprising approximately 25% of all known species. Their identification often requires significant taxonomic expertise, making them an ideal test case for AI-assisted identification systems. This research aims to address the taxonomic impediment by providing tools that can support both expert taxonomists and non-specialists.

**Methodological Approach:**
The project combines multiple approaches including image-based machine learning, morphometric analysis, and integration with existing taxonomic databases to create robust identification systems that can handle the vast morphological diversity within Coleoptera.

**Expected Outcomes:**
This research will contribute to the development of practical tools for museum curation and will advance our understanding of how AI can be effectively integrated into taxonomic workflows, potentially serving as a model for similar applications across other arthropod groups.
