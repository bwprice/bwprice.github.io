## PhD Graduate (2016-2021)

**Project Title:** Exploring the influence of climate change on the body size and ecology of aquatic insects over space and time

**Co-supervision:** Dr Phillip Fenberg (University of Southampton)

**Funding:** Royal Thai Government

**Research Focus:**
Rungtip's PhD research investigated one of the most fundamental biological responses to climate change - the relationship between temperature and body size in aquatic insects. Her work combined laboratory experiments, field studies, and analysis of museum collections to understand how warming temperatures affect insect morphology and ecology across temporal and spatial scales.

**Key Research Areas:**
- Climate change impacts on aquatic insects
- Temperature-size relationships
- Body size evolution and ecology
- Museum collection-based research
- Chironomidae (non-biting midges) ecology
- Long-term biodiversity change

**Research Methodology:**
Rungtip employed an innovative multi-faceted approach that included:
- Controlled mesocosm experiments with temperature manipulation
- Analysis of historical museum specimens spanning decades
- Morphometric analysis of wing length as a proxy for body size
- Statistical modeling of climate-trait relationships

**Research Significance:**
Her research provided crucial insights into how aquatic insects, which form the base of many freshwater food webs, respond to warming temperatures. This work has important implications for understanding ecosystem-level responses to climate change and predicting future biodiversity patterns.

**PhD Outcome:**
Rungtip successfully completed her PhD in 2021, producing several high-impact publications that have advanced our understanding of climate change impacts on freshwater ecosystems. Her work represents a significant contribution to the field of climate change biology.

**Publications:**
Her PhD research resulted in multiple peer-reviewed publications in leading journals, establishing her as an expert in temperature-size relationships in aquatic insects.
