## MSc Graduate (2023) - Published Research

**Project Title:** Review of the genus Deroplatys Westwood, 1839 (Mantidae: Deroplatyinae, Deroplatyini) with the description of three new species and a key to all known species

**Publication Status:** **Published** - Zootaxa 5445: 1-68 (2024)

**Research Focus:**
Richard's MSc research involved a comprehensive taxonomic revision of the mantid genus *Deroplatys*, focusing on morphological analysis, species delimitation, and the description of new species. His work included detailed examination of type specimens, morphological illustrations, and the development of identification keys.

**Key Research Areas:**
- Mantid (Mantodea) systematics
- Taxonomic revision and description
- Morphological analysis
- Species identification keys
- Museum specimen examination

**Research Achievements:**
- Description of three new species: *Deroplatys kinabaluensis* sp. nov., *D. nebula* sp. nov., and *D. xuzhengfai* sp. nov.
- Rediscovery and redescription of the holotype of *D. angustata* Westwood, 1841
- Establishment of new synonymy: *D. horrifica* as a junior synonym of *D. lobata*
- Creation of comprehensive identification keys for both sexes
- Detailed morphological illustrations and distribution mapping

**Research Significance:**
Richard's work represents a significant contribution to mantid systematics, clarifying the taxonomy of a morphologically complex genus and providing essential tools for future identification and research. The discovery and description of three new species highlights the continued importance of taxonomic research in documenting global biodiversity.

**Publication:**
Zhang, J.-Z. & Price, B.W. (2024) Revision of the genus *Deroplatys* Westwood, 1839 (Mantodea: Deroplatyidae) with the description of three new species. *Zootaxa* 5445(1): 1-68.

**Career Impact:**
This published research demonstrates Richard's capability in systematic entomology and provides a strong foundation for potential further research in insect taxonomy and systematics.
