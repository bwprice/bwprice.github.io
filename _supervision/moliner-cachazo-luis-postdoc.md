## Postdoctoral Researcher (2024-2025)

**Project Title:** GeneFlow: A pilot project to integrate eDNA metabarcoding into the CaSTCo project and the Riverfly Partnership, while improving NHM genomic collections for freshwater invertebrates

**Funding:** Natural History Museum Science Investment Funds

**Research Focus:**
Luis's postdoctoral research focuses on developing and implementing environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding approaches for freshwater ecosystem monitoring. The project aims to integrate cutting-edge molecular techniques with existing citizen science programs, specifically the CaSTCo project and the Riverfly Partnership. This work has significant implications for biodiversity monitoring and conservation efforts in freshwater environments.

**Key Research Areas:**
- Environmental DNA metabarcoding
- Freshwater invertebrate genomics
- Citizen science integration
- Museum genomic collections enhancement
- Biodiversity monitoring methodologies

**Background:**
Prior to his postdoctoral position, Luis completed his PhD research (2020-2024) on evaluating ecological assembly rules for aquatic-terrestrial transition zones in the Okavango Delta, Botswana, demonstrating his expertise in freshwater ecology and ecosystem dynamics.
