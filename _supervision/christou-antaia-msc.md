## MSc Graduate (2016) - Published Research

**Project Title:** Using museum specimens to uncover spatial and sexual differences in wing length of *Calopteryx virgo* (Odonata: Calopterygidae)

**Co-supervision:** Steve Brooks (Natural History Museum)

**Publication Status:** **Published** - Journal of the British Dragonfly Society 33(1): 29-49 (2017)

**Research Focus:**
Antaia's MSc research utilized museum specimens to investigate geographical and sexual variation in wing morphology of the Beautiful Demoiselle (*Calopteryx virgo*). Her work combined traditional morphometric approaches with large-scale analysis of museum collections to understand patterns of phenotypic variation across the species' range.

**Key Research Areas:**
- Odonata (dragonfly and damselfly) morphology
- Museum collection-based research
- Sexual dimorphism analysis
- Geographic variation patterns
- Wing morphometry
- Climate-trait relationships

**Research Methodology:**
Antaia employed museum specimens from the Natural History Museum collections to measure wing length across multiple populations of *C. virgo*, allowing for analysis of both geographic and climatic variables affecting wing size. This approach demonstrated the value of museum collections for addressing ecological and evolutionary questions.

**Research Significance:**
This study provided insights into how environmental factors influence morphological traits in odonates and demonstrated the potential for museum specimens to reveal patterns of phenotypic variation across space and time. The work contributes to our understanding of how climate variables may influence insect morphology.

**Research Impact:**
This published research demonstrates the value of combining museum collections with morphometric analysis to address questions in evolutionary ecology, providing a foundation for similar studies in other insect groups.
