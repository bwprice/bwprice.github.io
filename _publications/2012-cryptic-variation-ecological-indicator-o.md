Background: Baetis harrisoni Barnard is a mayfly frequently encountered in river studies across Africa, but the external morphological features used for identifying nymphs have been observed to vary subtly between different geographic locations.  It has been associated with a wide range of ecological conditions, including pH extremes of pH 2.
