Historical biogeography studies have at their disposal a small suite of vicariance models to explain genetic differentiation within and between species.  One of these processes involves the role of river catchments and their associated watersheds, in driving diversiÔ¨Åcation and is applicable to both aquatic and terrestrial organisms.
