While previous studies have highlighted the potential of DNA-based methods for the biomonitoring of freshwater macroinvertebrates, a limited number have investigated homogenization of bulk samples that include debris, in order to reduce sample-processing costs.  This study explores the use of several DNA-based survey methods for water quality and biodiversity assessment in South Africa, comparing morphological and molecular-based identification of freshwater macroinvertebrates at the family l...
