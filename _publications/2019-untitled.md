The Platypleurini is a large group of charismatic cicadas distributed from Cape Agulhas in South Africa, through tropical Africa, Madagascar, India and eastern Asia to Japan, with generic diversity concentrated in equatorial and southern Africa.  This distribution suggests the possibility of a Gondwanan origin and dispersal to eastern Asia from Africa or India.
