Background There are approximately one hundred thousand aquatic insect species currently known to science and this ﬁgure is likely a signiﬁcant underestimation.  The ecology of aquatic insect groups has been studied due to their role as bioindicators of water quality and in the case of Diptera, their role as vectors of disease.
