Over the last decade, steady advancements have been made in the use of DNA-based methods for detection of species in a wide range of ecosystems.  This progress has culminated in molecular monitoring methods being employed for the detection of several species for enforceable management purposes of endangered, invasive, and illegally harvested species worldwide.
