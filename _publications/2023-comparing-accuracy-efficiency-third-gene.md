New genomic technologies, such as third generation sequencing (TGS), have enabled for high-throughput, rapid, and cost-effective data generation of non-model organisms, accelerating taxonomic identification studies and contributing to conservation applications.  Here, we present the first comparison of the two leading TGS providers, Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), for the purpose of DNA barcoding, using morphological identification and Sanger sequencing as...
