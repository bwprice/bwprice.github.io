Abstract The antlion genus Gatzara Navás, 1915 is one of the major lineages of the subfamily Dendroleontinae Banks, 1899 (Neuroptera: Myrmeleontidae) from Asia, but has a complex systematic background.  Here we present a comprehensive systematic revision and mitochondrial phylogenomic analysis to clarify the identity of this genus, and to unravel its evolutionary history.
