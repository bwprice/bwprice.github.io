DNA – based methods offer a significant opportunity to monitor individual species and species assemblages where appropriate, for example those that may be difficult to monitor using traditional methods.  However, with the exception of some individual species such as the great crested newt, there is still much development of these techniques required before they can be used in routine monitoring.
