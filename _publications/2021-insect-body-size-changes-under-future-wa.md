Abstract Chironomids are a useful group for investigating body size responses to warming due to their high local abundance and sensitivity to environmental change.  We collected specimens of six species of chironomids every 2 weeks over a 2-year period (2017–2018) from mesocosm experiments using five ponds at ambient temperature and five ponds at 4°C higher than ambient temperature.
