Low coverage ‘genome-skims’ are often used to assemble organelle genomes and ribosomal gene sequences for cost-effective phylogenetic and barcoding studies.  Natural history collections hold invaluable biological information, yet poor preservation resulting in degraded DNA often hinders polymerase chain reaction-based analyses.
