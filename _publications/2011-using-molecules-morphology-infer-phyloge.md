The ﬁrst empirically supported phylogenetic hypothesis of relationships for the southern African endemic butterﬂy tribe Dirini is presented.  Data derived from the morphology and ecology of the adults and immature stages (33 characters), and portions of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase I (COI ) and the nuclear genes elongation factor 1 α (EF1 α) and wingless (WG) (totalling 1734 bp) were used to infer the relationships of the in-group genera.
