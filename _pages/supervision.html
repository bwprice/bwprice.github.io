**Research Areas:** My supervision covers diverse topics including molecular systematics, digital natural history, computer vision applications, freshwater ecology, climate change biology, and taxonomic research. I particularly encourage interdisciplinary approaches that combine traditional biological expertise with modern computational and molecular methods.
