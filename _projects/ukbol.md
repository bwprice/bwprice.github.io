## Project Overview

The UK Barcode of Life (UKBOL) is a national initiative coordinated by the Natural History Museum to generate a comprehensive DNA reference library for all UK species. This project addresses critical gaps in DNA reference libraries that have been identified as one of the main barriers preventing the uptake of DNA-based methods for environmental species monitoring. As project coordinator, I lead efforts to generate DNA reference libraries from modern and historical voucher specimens through barcoding and genome skimming approaches.

**Duration:** 2020 - ongoing
**Funding:** Natural History Museum, Natural England, Defra DNA Centre of Excellence

## Objectives

- Generate comprehensive DNA barcode coverage for approximately 75,000 UK eukaryotic species
- Prioritize species critical for monitoring sensitive sites (e.g. SSSIs)
- Develop and maintain the UKBOL website and data portal for continuous gap analysis
- Coordinate national DNA barcoding efforts through steering group activities
- Integrate with international initiatives (iBOL) and the Darwin Tree of Life project

## Methodology

The project employs multiple molecular approaches including traditional PCR amplification for fresh specimens and genome skimming techniques for historical museum specimens. Priority species are identified based on consultation (e.g. assemblages within the Pantheon database). All sequence data and specimen records are uploaded to the Barcode of Life Database (BOLD) for global access.
