## Project Overview

The Biodiversity Genomics Europe (BGE) Consortium represents a groundbreaking initiative to accelerate the use of genomic science for understanding, monitoring, and conserving European biodiversity. This ambitious project brings together DNA barcoding and genome sequencing communities across Europe for the first time at this scale.

### Key Objectives

**Capacity Building**
- Establish functioning biodiversity genomics networks at the European level
- Create European nodes for the International Barcode of Life (iBOL) and Earth BioGenome Project (EBP)
- Connect communities and grow capacity to tackle the biodiversity crisis using genomic tools

**Production at Scale**
- Implement large-scale biodiversity genomic data generation pipelines across Europe
- Accelerate production and accessibility of genomic data for biodiversity characterization
- Establish standardized workflows from field sampling to data applications

**Applied Genomics**
- Apply genomic tools to enhance understanding of pan-European biodiversity
- Improve efficacy of management interventions and biomonitoring programmes
- Focus on threatened/endangered species, ecological keystone species, and economically important species

## Consortium Structure

BGE unites **33 institutions** across **20 countries**, bringing together two major networks:

- **BIOSCAN Europe**: European node of the International Barcode of Life (iBOL)
- **ERGA**: European Reference Genome Atlas, affiliated with the Earth BioGenome Project (EBP)

## Scientific Approach

### Two Complementary Streams

**DNA Barcoding Stream (iBOL Europe)**
- Building comprehensive barcode reference libraries
- Developing DNA-based biomonitoring programmes
- Focusing on pollinators and indicator species for aquatic systems

**Genome Sequencing Stream (ERGA)**
- Generating high-quality reference genomes for European species
- Establishing distributed infrastructure for genome production
- Creating atlas of complete genome sequences

### Cross-cutting Activities
- Joint training and capacity building
- Integrated data management frameworks
- Citizen science engagement
- Policy and ethics compliance

## Expected Outputs

### Data Production
- **450 Gbp** of annotated reference genome assemblies (350-500 species)
- **45,000** specimen barcodes with comprehensive metadata
- **50,000** 'dark taxa' specimens barcoded for species discovery
- **5,000** metabarcode libraries for biomonitoring
- Curated European barcode reference libraries for key taxa

### Infrastructure Development
- Enhanced European BOLD (Barcode of Life Data Systems)
- Reference genome public data portal
- Standardized protocols and workflows
- Training programmes and knowledge transfer networks

### Applications
- Pan-European pollinator barcode library completion
- Harmonized biomonitoring protocols
- Conservation genomics case studies
- Tools for intraspecific genetic diversity assessment

## Innovation and Impact

### Scientific Innovation
- First large-scale coordination of European biodiversity genomics
- Integration of DNA barcoding and genome sequencing workflows
- Development of multi-locus barcoding approaches
- Scalable high-throughput sequencing protocols

### Conservation Impact
- Enhanced species discovery and identification capabilities
- Improved biomonitoring for ecosystem health assessment
- Tools for tracking biodiversity change and population dynamics
- Support for conservation management decisions

### European Leadership
- Positioning Europe as a leader in biodiversity genomics
- Creating sustainable networks beyond project lifetime
- Influencing global biodiversity genomics standards
- Supporting EU biodiversity strategy implementation

## Citizen Science Integration

BGE actively engages citizen scientists through multiple pathways:

- **Expert Amateur Naturalists**: Supporting specimen collection and identification
- **Public BioBlitzes**: Community sampling events for DNA barcoding
- **Marine Biomonitoring**: eDNA sampling for invasive species detection
- **Reference Library Curation**: Collaborative data validation and interpretation

## Open Science Commitment

The project adheres to FAIR data principles:
- **Findable**: Persistent identifiers for all datasets
- **Accessible**: Open access by default with appropriate licensing
- **Interoperable**: Community metadata standards and data integration
- **Reusable**: Creative Commons licensing and comprehensive documentation

## Timeline and Milestones

**Duration**: September 2021 - February 2026

## Future Vision

BGE establishes the foundation for:
- Continent-wide biodiversity monitoring systems
- Routine genomic assessment of ecosystem health
- Rapid species discovery and identification
- Genomic-informed conservation strategies
- Integration with global biodiversity initiatives

The project represents a critical step toward comprehensive understanding and protection of European biodiversity through cutting-edge genomic technologies and unprecedented international collaboration.
