## Project Overview

This project aims to develop robust computer vision and machine learning tools for automated species identification from digital photographs. By training deep learning models on large datasets of taxonomically verified images, we seek to create tools that can assist both researchers and citizen scientists in rapid, accurate species identification.

**Duration:** January 2023 - ongoing
**Funding:** Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)
**Collaborators:** 
- Natural History Museum, London
- Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew
- iNaturalist platform

## Objectives

- Develop convolutional neural networks for multi-species identification
- Create user-friendly mobile and web applications for field identification
- Establish quality control mechanisms for citizen science data
- Integrate tools with existing biodiversity databases and platforms

## Methodology

The project employs deep learning approaches, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), trained on large datasets of taxonomically verified specimen images. We use transfer learning from pre-trained models and implement novel attention mechanisms to focus on taxonomically relevant features.

## Key Research Areas

- Computer vision and image recognition
- Deep learning and neural networks
- Biodiversity informatics
- Citizen science and public engagement
- Digital natural history collections

## Current Status/Progress

We have successfully trained initial models for British flora (500+ species) with 85% accuracy. Mobile app prototype is under development, and partnerships with citizen science platforms are being established.

## Outputs

**Publications:**
- "Deep Learning Approaches for Automated Plant Identification" (in preparation)

**Software/Tools:**
- SpeciesNet mobile application (beta testing)
- Web-based identification portal

**Data/Resources:**
- Curated dataset of 100,000+ taxonomically verified images
- Species identification API for third-party applications

## Significance

This project addresses the critical bottleneck in biodiversity research - the taxonomic impediment - by providing accessible tools for species identification. The outputs will enhance biodiversity monitoring, support conservation efforts, and engage the public in scientific research.

## Future Directions

Plans include expanding to additional taxonomic groups, developing real-time identification capabilities, and integrating with environmental DNA (eDNA) detection methods for comprehensive biodiversity assessment tools.
